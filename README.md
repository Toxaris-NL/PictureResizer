# PictureResizer
Resizes JPG pictures to specified file size and quality. There are many tools out there that are able to do this, but this one is a bit different. With this one you can enter a target filesize instead of a target resolution.

It works on two levels to reach the desired filesize. The first action is lowering the JPG quality gradually to a minimum of 85%. If this is not sufficient, the resolution will then be lowered, until the target filesize is reached. The aspect ration will be retained. 

The tool also has a batch functionality.

The tool is created for personal use, so from a programmers point of view it could probably be improved upon greatly.
